## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install koa-cors-gate
```

[yarn][]:

```sh
yarn add koa-cors-gate
```


## Usage

```js
const Koa = require('koa');
const CorsGate = require('koa-cors-gate');

const app = new Koa();

app.use(
  new CorsGate({
    allowSafe: false,
    origin: 'http://localhost'
  }).middleware
);
```

### Alternative failure handling

By default, `koa-cors-gate` will return `403 Unauthorized` to any requests that aren't permitted by the specified options.

The `failure` option offers a means to change this behavior. This way, unauthorized cross-origin requests can be permitted in a restricted manner - perhaps by requiring an explicit authentication mechanism rather than cookie-based authentication to prevent cross-site scripting. As such, `cors-gate` can serve as a CSRF mechanism without the need for a token, while still allowing limited forms of third-party cross-origin API requests.

```js
app.use(new CorsGate({
  origin: 'http://localhost',
  failure: ({req, res}, next) => {
    // requests from other origins will have this flag set.
    req.requireExplicitAuthentication = true;
  }
}).middleware);
```

### Firefox and the Origin header

Firefox does not set the `Origin` header [on same-origin requests](http://stackoverflow.com/a/15514049/495611) (see also [csrf-request-tester](https://github.com/mixmaxhq/csrf-request-tester)) for same-origin requests, as of version 53. The `corsGate.originFallbackToReferrer` middleware will, if the `Origin` header is missing, fill it with the origin part of the `Referer`. This middleware thus enables verification of the `Origin` for same-origin requests.

Additionally, no browser sends the `Origin` header when sending a `GET` request to load an image. We could simply allow all `GET` requests - `GET` requests are safe, per `HTTP` - but we'd rather reject unauthorized cross-origin `GET` requests wholesale.

At present, Chrome and Safari do not support the `strict-origin` `Referrer-Policy`, so we can only patch the `Origin` from the `Referer` on Firefox. In patching it, however, we can reject unauthorized cross-origin `GET` requests from images, and once Chrome and Safari support `strict-origin`, we'll be able to do so on all three platforms.

In order to actually reject these requests, however, the patched `Origin` data must be visible to the `cors` middleware. This middleware is distinct because it must appear before `cors` and `corsGate` to perform all the described tasks.

```js
app.use(corsGate.originFallbackToReferrer());
app.use(cors({ ... }));
app.use(new CorsGate({ ... }));
```
